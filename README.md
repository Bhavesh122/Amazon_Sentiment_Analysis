# Amazon_Sentiment_Analysis
Instead of spending a considerable amount of time determining whether a product is good or not, I have developed a Python program utilizing NLP. This program analyzes the review section of Amazon, allowing us to extract insights efficiently. Additionally, it enables us to find reviews related to specific topics.

We are going to giving input of the Amazon reviews of a par5cular product link. It is going to ask how many pages should it explore. Once we men5on that it will the percentage of posi5ve reviews and nega5ve reviews with the help of bar graph. Later we if you want to see a particular topic (“ display of a mobile”) if you mention it , it is going to show the related reviews about display.
